Flower

Until I call his name
he just was
a mere gesture.

When I called his name
he came to me
became a flower.

Just like I called his name
call my name
good for my color and scent.
I'd go to him
and will be his flower.

We all
want to be.
I for you, you for me,
want to be a meaning not fades away.
